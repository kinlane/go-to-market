We have setup the podcast using Apple Podcasts, which can be accessed through the creator profile and viewable using the public feed. It keeps the cached API Evangelist logo, but everything should be upated -- we are watching closely.

The podcast feed for the podcast, which powers Apple is managed using a GitHub repo and published using GitHub Pages:

We are still working on the static landing pages via the website, and will update the feed when we have those, and once we have more speakers across more industries we will likely update more.
