We manually publish each podcast episode to Spotify right now, but will explore how to do with a capability, but for now the Spotify podcast is accessible through the creator and public links:

- [**Creator**](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/595bB8JdW35Qv7Yn6JFmF4/home)
- [**Public**](https://open.spotify.com/show/595bB8JdW35Qv7Yn6JFmF4)

Once we have the Spotify API profiled we will be able to understand what we are capable of, and work to automate more of how we manage the Spotify presence, aligning with Apple which is automated via GitHub feed.
