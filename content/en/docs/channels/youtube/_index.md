We have begin publishing the Naftiko Capabilities podcast to YouTube using a specific channel and the creator tools. It publishes in a better format when I do it directly from Camtasia, so will be using the local editor to publish.

- [**Playlist**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdRRCIXKNApLkItxj0skD8gWJL2N15qDF)

As we begin creating more shorts and other videos beyond the podcast we will begin adding other playlists, as well as likely some ad hoc videos that are there to just support individual stories, keepign the channel active.
