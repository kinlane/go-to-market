description: This is the overview of the go-to-market motion, and how we use this site and the YAML behind it to drive Naftiko marketing forward in way that is accessible to the community, helping make our go-to-market and shared effort from the beginning, doing it all out in the open.

As we work to define our go-to-market motion at Naftiko we felt there was no reason to keep the process behind a secret. We have an initial plan in place, but our go-to-market is someething that will continue to evolve and change over time based upon the stories we tell and the conversations we have, so we thought it would help increase the velocity of our go-to-market flywheel if we just did it all out in the open.

The majority of the conversations we are having in the ecosystem are public, so it makes sense that we define, develop, publish, and syndicate those stories out in the open. A big part of our go-to-market effort is to openly figure out what the go-to-market effort for an open-source commercial software means, which is something we are more than happy to share with the wider open-source and API ecosystems.

This work is managed using Hugo/Docsy, but more importantly using YAML in GitHub. All of the stories, conversations, services, channels, and other information used as part of the go-to-market motion is stored simply as YAML and then synced with other platforms like Google Docs, Notion, and wherever the work for go-to-market activities occurs, with this documentation site being the central reference and point of automation for all of this work.
