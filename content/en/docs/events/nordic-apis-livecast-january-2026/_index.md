API Standards for AI Agents
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Learn why API technical standards drive agentic success.
Join us for a LiveCast on API standards and AI agents, exploring how core API and open web standards enable accurate, reliable, and safe agent behavior.

AI agents are getting arms and legs with APIs. But they need a technical manifest to fully understand their capabilities. This is where core web and API standards shine, acting as rich semantics and metadata to both inform agents and optimize their context windows.

In this hour-long LiveCast, we’ll bring together API experts with experience pioneering standards for entire industries as well as individual enterprise-level API and API governance strategies. We’ll consider how to think about technical API standards (and how they can be combined) as you construct pathways to connect with AI agents and the benefits of a standards-based approach.

Our speakers will explore core technical standards that are helpful to position APIs for AI agents. These include OpenAPI, new OpenAPI add-ons like Arazzo and Overlays specifications, REST and link relations using hypermedia (HATEOAS), IETF standards, HTTP methods and headers, JSON-LD, MCP, and others.

The LiveCast will feature Kin Lane, the API Evangelist and Chief Community Officer (CCO) at Naftiko, and Lorna Mitchell, API Architect at TM Forum and Technical Steering Committee Member at OpenAPI Initiative (OAI). Bill Doerrfeld, tech journalist and Editor-in-Chief at Nordic APIs, will moderate the discussion and audience Q&A. The panel discussion will be recorded over Zoom and published to YouTube shortly after the event.
