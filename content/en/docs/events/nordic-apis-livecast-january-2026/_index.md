APIDays was great. Definitely the place to launch Naftiko. The conversation were leaning heavy in the vendor direction, but still was a great time overall. The conversations were excellent, with lead generation being just OK. But, without a product yet, this is fine, as we were just looking to enter the market, and get the conversation going.
