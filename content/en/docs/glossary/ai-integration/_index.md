AI integration is the process of embedding artificial intelligence capabilities—such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, or predictive analytics—into existing systems, applications, workflows, or products to enhance their functionality, automation, and decision-making.

It typically involves connecting AI models or services (like GPT, image recognition APIs, or custom ML models) to software via APIs, SDKs, or data pipelines so the system can analyze data, make predictions, or interact intelligently with users.

In practice, AI integration can mean:

- Enhancing automation — letting systems take over repetitive or complex decision processes.
- Improving user experience — using chatbots, recommendation engines, or personalization models.
- Optimizing operations — integrating AI into analytics, monitoring, or workflow systems to improve efficiency and reduce cost.
- Creating new capabilities — such as predictive maintenance, fraud detection, or adaptive learning environments.

It’s often a key stage of digital transformation, connecting AI systems with enterprise infrastructure (e.g., CRM, ERP, or APIs) to make data and intelligence work seamlessly across the organization.
