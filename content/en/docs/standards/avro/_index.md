Compact binary data serialization.

Apache Avro is a data serialization framework developed within the Apache Hadoop project that provides a compact, fast binary data format along with rich data structures and schema definitions. Created by Doug Cutting (the creator of Hadoop) in 2009, Avro addresses the need for efficient data serialization in big data ecosystems where massive volumes of data must be stored and transmitted efficiently. Unlike JSON or XML which use verbose text-based formats, Avro serializes data into a compact binary representation that significantly reduces storage requirements and network bandwidth while maintaining fast serialization and deserialization performance. Avro schemas are defined using JSON, making them human-readable and language-independent, and these schemas travel with the data (either embedded in files or referenced through a schema registry), ensuring that any system can correctly interpret the serialized data without prior knowledge of its structure. This self-describing nature makes Avro particularly valuable in distributed systems where different services written in different languages need to exchange data reliably.

One of Avro's most powerful features is its robust support for schema evolution, which allows data schemas to change over time without breaking compatibility between producers and consumers of that data. Avro supports both forward compatibility (new code can read old data) and backward compatibility (old code can read new data) through features like default values for fields, optional fields, and union types. This makes it ideal for long-lived data storage and streaming systems where data structures evolve as business requirements change. Avro has become a cornerstone technology in the big data ecosystem, widely used with Apache Kafka for streaming data pipelines (where the Confluent Schema Registry manages Avro schemas), Apache Spark for data processing, Apache Hive for data warehousing, and as the serialization format for Hadoop's remote procedure calls. Avro supports rich data types including primitive types (null, boolean, int, long, float, double, bytes, string), complex types (records, enums, arrays, maps, unions, fixed), and logical types (decimals, dates, timestamps), and provides code generation capabilities that create type-safe classes in languages like Java, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, and PHP. Its combination of compact binary encoding, strong schema support, language independence, and schema evolution capabilities makes Avro the preferred serialization format for many data-intensive applications, particularly in streaming architectures and data lakes.
