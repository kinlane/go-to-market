Bruno collections are structured groups of API requests, variables, and environments used within the Bruno API client to help developers organize and manage their API workflows. Each collection acts as a self-contained workspace where you can store requests, define authentication, set environment values, document behaviors, and run tests. Designed with a filesystem-first approach, Bruno collections are easy to version-control and share, making them especially useful for teams collaborating on API development or maintaining consistent testing practices across environments.
