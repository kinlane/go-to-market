HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational markup language of the World Wide Web, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, that defines the structure and content of web pages through a system of elements enclosed in angle-bracket tags. HTML provides the semantic framework for organizing information on the web, using tags like <h1> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, <a> for hyperlinks, <img> for images, <table> for tabular data, and <form> for user input. These elements create a hierarchical document structure called the Document Object Model (DOM) that web browsers parse and render into the visual pages users see and interact with. HTML is a declarative language, meaning developers describe what content should appear and how it should be structured rather than specifying how to display it—the actual visual presentation is handled by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), while interactive behavior is managed by JavaScript. This separation of concerns allows HTML to focus purely on semantic meaning and content structure, making web pages accessible to screen readers, search engines, and various devices.

Modern HTML (currently HTML5, standardized by the W3C and WHATWG) has evolved far beyond simple text formatting to support rich multimedia content, complex web applications, and interactive experiences without requiring plugins. HTML5 introduced semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, and <footer> that provide meaningful structure for both developers and assistive technologies, improving accessibility and SEO. The language now includes native support for audio and video playback through <audio> and <video> tags, canvas-based graphics via <canvas>, scalable vector graphics with inline SVG, form validation, local storage APIs, geolocation, and drag-and-drop functionality. HTML forms the skeleton of every website and web application, working in conjunction with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity to create the complete web experience. Its role extends beyond traditional websites to include email templates, hybrid mobile applications, progressive web apps, documentation systems, and even desktop applications built with frameworks like Electron. As a cornerstone technology of the web, HTML remains backward-compatible while continuously evolving to meet the demands of modern web development.
