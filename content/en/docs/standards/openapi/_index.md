The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a formal standard for describing HTTP APIs. It enables teams to understand how an API works and how multiple APIs interoperate, generate client code, create tests, apply design standards, and more.

OpenAPI was formerly known as Swagger. In 2015, SmartBear donated the specification to the Linux Foundation, establishing the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) and a formal, community-driven governance model that anyone can participate in.

An OpenAPI document can be written in JSON or YAML and typically defines elements such as: Info, Contact, License, Servers, Components, Paths and Operations, Parameters, Request Bodies, Media Types and Encoding, Responses, Callbacks, Examples, Links, Headers, Tags, Schemas, and Security.

OpenAPI has an active GitHub organization, blog, LinkedIn page, and Slack channel to encourage community participation. In addition, OAI membership helps fund projects and events that drive awareness and adoption.

The OpenAPI Specification can be used alongside two other OAI specifications: (1) the Arazzo specification for defining API-driven workflows, and (2) OpenAPI Overlays, which allow additional information to be overlaid onto an OpenAPI document.
