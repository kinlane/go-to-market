A vCard is a standardized digital format for storing and exchanging contact information across different applications and devices. It can contain details such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, organization information, URLs, and even photos or custom fields. Commonly shared as .vcf files, vCards allow contacts to be imported or exported easily between email clients, mobile phones, CRM systems, and other address book tools. This makes them a convenient, portable way to transfer personal or business contact details in a consistent, machine-readable format.
