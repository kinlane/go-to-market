OPA (Open Policy Agent) is a general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across your stack—improving developer velocity, security, and auditability. It provides a high-level, declarative language (Rego) for expressing policies across a wide range of use cases.

Originally developed at Styra in 2016, OPA was donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in 2018 and graduated in 2021.

Rego includes rules and rulesets, unit tests, functions and built-ins, reserved keywords, conditionals, comprehensions/iterations, lookups, assignment, and comparison/equality operators—giving you a concise, expressive way to author and validate policy.

You can contribute on GitHub, follow updates via the blog and its RSS feed, and join conversations in the community Slack and on the OPA LinkedIn page.

OPA works across platforms and operational layers, standardizing policy for key infrastructure such as Kubernetes, API gateways, Docker, CI/CD, and more. It also helps normalize policy across diverse data and API integration patterns used in application and agent automation.
