CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple, plain-text file format used to store tabular data in a structured way where each line represents a row and values within each row are separated by commas (or other delimiters like semicolons, tabs, or pipes). This straightforward format makes CSV one of the most universally supported data exchange formats, readable by spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and LibreOffice Calc, as well as databases, data analysis tools, and virtually every programming language. CSV files are human-readable when opened in a text editor, showing data in a grid-like structure that closely mirrors how it would appear in a spreadsheet. The format's simplicity—requiring no special markup, tags, or complex syntax—makes it ideal for representing datasets, lists, reports, and any tabular information where relationships between columns and rows need to be preserved.

Despite its simplicity, CSV has become essential for data import/export operations, data migration between systems, bulk data loading into databases, and sharing datasets for data analysis and machine learning. The format is particularly valuable in business contexts for handling customer lists, financial records, inventory data, sales reports, and scientific datasets. CSV files are compact and efficient, requiring minimal storage space compared to more verbose formats like XML or JSON, which makes them ideal for transferring large datasets over networks or storing historical data archives. However, CSV has limitations: it lacks standardized support for data types (everything is typically treated as text unless parsed), has no built-in schema definition, struggles with representing hierarchical or nested data, and can encounter issues with special characters, line breaks within fields, or commas in data values (typically addressed by enclosing fields in quotes). Despite these constraints, CSV remains the go-to format for flat, rectangular data exchange due to its universal compatibility, ease of use, and the fact that it can be created and edited with the most basic tools, from text editors to sophisticated data processing frameworks.
