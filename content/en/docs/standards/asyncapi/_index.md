AsyncAPI is an open-source, protocol-agnostic specification for describing event-driven APIs and message-driven applications. It serves as the OpenAPI of the asynchronous, event-driven world—overlapping with, and often going beyond, what OpenAPI covers.

The specification began as an open-source side project and was later donated to the Linux Foundation after the team joined Postman, establishing it as a standard with formal governance.

AsyncAPI lets you define servers, producers and consumers, channels, protocols, and messages used in event-driven API operations—providing a common, tool-friendly way to describe the surface area of event-driven APIs.

To get involved, visit the AsyncAPI GitHub repository and blog, follow the LinkedIn page, tune into the YouTube or Twitch channels, and join the conversation in the community Slack.

AsyncAPI can be used to define HTTP APIs much like OpenAPI, and it further supports multiple protocols such as Pub/Sub, Kafka, MQTT, NATS, Redis, SNS, Solace, AMQP, JMS, and WebSockets—making it useful across many approaches to delivering APIs.
