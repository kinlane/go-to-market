Community-driven schema vocabulary for people, places, and things.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Schema.org is a collaborative, community-driven vocabulary that defines shared types and properties to describe things on the web—people, places, products, events, and more—so search engines and other consumers can understand page content.  Publishers annotate pages using formats like JSON-LD (now the common choice), Microdata, or RDFa to express this structured data, which enables features such as rich results, knowledge panels, and better content discovery. The project maintains core and extension vocabularies, evolves through open proposals and discussion, and focuses on practical, interoperable semantics rather than being tied to a single standard body.
