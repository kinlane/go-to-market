description: JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linking Data) is a W3C standard for expressing linked data in JSON. It adds lightweight semantics to ordinary JSON so machines can understand what the data means, not just its shape—by mapping keys to globally unique identifiers (IRIs) via a @context. Common features include @id (identity), @type (class), and optional graph constructs (@graph).

It adds lightweight semantics to ordinary JSON so machines can understand what the data means, not just its shape—by mapping keys to globally unique identifiers (IRIs) via a @context. Common features include @id (identity), @type (class), and optional graph constructs (@graph).
