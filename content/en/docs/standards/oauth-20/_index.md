title: OAuth 2.0
description: OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard protocol that enables secure, delegated access to APIs without requiring users to share their passwords with applications. Instead of handing over credentials, a user authorizes a trusted identity provider—such as Google, Microsoft, or an enterprise login system—to issue short-lived access tokens to a client application.

OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on third-party services without exposing user passwords. Developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and published as RFC 6749 in 2012, OAuth 2.0 solves the fundamental problem of secure delegated access—allowing users to grant applications permission to access their data on other services (like Google, Facebook, GitHub, or Microsoft) without sharing their login credentials. Instead of giving an application your password, OAuth 2.0 uses access tokens: temporary, limited-scope credentials that specify exactly what data the application can access and for how long. This token-based approach is what powers the "Sign in with Google" or "Connect with GitHub" buttons seen across the web, enabling seamless single sign-on (SSO) experiences while maintaining security. The framework defines four primary authorization flows (or "grant types"): Authorization Code Grant for server-side web applications, Implicit Grant (now deprecated) for browser-based apps, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine communication, and Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant for trusted applications, each tailored to different security requirements and use cases.

OAuth 2.0 operates through a carefully orchestrated dance between four parties: the Resource Owner (the user), the Client (the application requesting access), the Authorization Server (which authenticates the user and issues tokens), and the Resource Server (which hosts the protected data). When a user wants to connect an application to their account on another service, they're redirected to the authorization server where they authenticate and explicitly consent to the permissions being requested. Upon approval, the authorization server issues an authorization code (in the most secure flow) which the client application exchanges for an access token and optionally a refresh token. The access token—typically a JSON Web Token (JWT) or opaque string—is then included in API requests to the resource server to prove authorization. OAuth 2.0 has become the backbone of modern API security and is used by virtually every major platform including Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Salesforce, and thousands of other services. The framework has evolved with extensions like PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to secure mobile and single-page applications, token introspection for validating tokens, and token revocation for ending sessions. While OAuth 2.0 handles authorization (what you're allowed to do), it's often used alongside OpenID Connect (OIDC), an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 that adds authentication (who you are), together forming the foundation for modern identity and access management in web, mobile, and API ecosystems.
