JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, self-contained token format used to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object that can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. Defined by RFC 7519, JWTs provide a stateless way to handle authentication and authorization in modern web applications, APIs, and microservices architectures. A JWT consists of three parts separated by dots: a header (containing the token type and signing algorithm), a payload (containing claims or statements about the user and additional metadata), and a signature (used to verify the token hasn't been tampered with). The entire token is Base64URL-encoded, making it URL-safe and easy to transmit in HTTP headers, URL parameters, or cookies. Unlike opaque tokens that require a server to look up session data in a database, JWTs are self-contained—all the information needed to validate and use the token is embedded within it, allowing stateless authentication where servers don't need to maintain session state. This makes JWTs particularly valuable in distributed systems, microservices, and mobile applications where scalability and reduced database lookups are important.

JWTs support multiple signing algorithms including HMAC (symmetric signing with a shared secret) and RSA/ECDSA (asymmetric signing with public/private key pairs), with the signature ensuring that the token content hasn't been modified and verifying the issuer's identity. The payload contains claims—standardized fields like iss (issuer), sub (subject/user ID), aud (audience), exp (expiration time), iat (issued at), and nbf (not before), along with custom claims for application-specific data like user roles, permissions, or profile information. When a user successfully authenticates, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client, which then includes this token in subsequent requests (typically in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header). The receiving service can validate the JWT's signature, check its expiration, and extract claims without needing to query a database or call back to the authentication server, enabling fast, distributed authorization decisions. JWTs have become the de facto standard for OAuth 2.0 access tokens and are central to OpenID Connect ID tokens, used extensively in single sign-on systems, API authentication, mobile app sessions, and serverless architectures. However, because JWTs cannot be easily invalidated before expiration (since they're stateless), best practices include using short expiration times, implementing token refresh mechanisms, maintaining token blacklists for critical security events, and never storing sensitive information in the payload since Base64 encoding is not encryption and anyone can decode and read the token's contents.
