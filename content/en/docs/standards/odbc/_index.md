ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is a standard application programming interface developed by Microsoft in the early 1990s that provides a universal method for applications to access different database management systems through a consistent set of function calls. ODBC acts as a middleware layer that sits between applications and databases, abstracting the complexities of different database protocols and SQL dialects behind a standardized interface. Applications use ODBC function calls to connect to databases, execute SQL statements, retrieve results, and manage transactions, while database-specific ODBC drivers translate these standard calls into the native commands understood by each particular database system (such as Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2, or Access). This architecture enables developers to write database code once and deploy it across multiple database platforms by simply changing the ODBC driver and connection string, rather than rewriting data access logic for each database vendor. ODBC supports both Windows and Unix-like systems (through projects like unixODBC and iODBC), making it a truly cross-platform solution for database connectivity.

ODBC provides a comprehensive set of capabilities including connection management through the ODBC Driver Manager, statement execution via handles that represent database connections and SQL statements, result set processing with cursors for navigating query results, transaction control with commit and rollback operations, and metadata discovery to query database structure and capabilities at runtime. The API supports prepared statements with parameter binding for improved performance and SQL injection prevention, batch operations for efficient bulk processing, and stored procedure execution. ODBC has become the foundation for database connectivity in many programming languages and frameworks—it's used directly in C/C++ applications, accessed through wrappers in languages like Python (pyodbc), PHP (ODBC extension), Ruby, and Perl, and serves as the underlying technology for higher-level data access frameworks like ADO.NET, OLE DB, and various ORM tools. While JDBC provides similar functionality for Java applications, ODBC remains the dominant standard for database connectivity in Windows environments, business intelligence tools (like Tableau, Power BI, and Crystal Reports), reporting systems, ETL tools, and legacy applications. Despite the emergence of native database drivers and modern database APIs, ODBC continues to be widely used in enterprise environments due to its maturity, broad database support, standardization, and the extensive ecosystem of tools and applications built around it.
