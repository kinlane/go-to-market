Apache Parquet is a columnar storage file format specifically designed for efficient data storage and processing in big data analytics environments, developed as a collaboration between Twitter and Cloudera in 2013 and now part of the Apache Software Foundation. Unlike traditional row-oriented formats (like CSV or Avro) that store data records sequentially, Parquet organizes data by columns, grouping all values from the same column together in storage. This columnar approach provides significant advantages for analytical workloads where queries typically access only a subset of columns from wide tables—instead of reading entire rows and discarding unneeded columns, Parquet allows systems to read only the specific columns required for a query, dramatically reducing I/O operations and improving query performance. The format also enables highly effective compression since values in the same column tend to have similar characteristics and patterns, allowing compression algorithms like Snappy, Gzip, LZO, and Zstandard to achieve much better compression ratios than they would on mixed-type row data. Parquet files are self-describing, containing schema information and metadata that allow any processing system to understand the data structure without external schema definitions.

Parquet has become the de facto standard for analytical data storage in modern data lakes and big data ecosystems, with native support across virtually all major data processing frameworks including Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache Impala, Presto, Trino, Apache Drill, and cloud data warehouses like Amazon Athena, Google BigQuery, Azure Synapse, and Snowflake. The format supports rich data types including nested and repeated structures (arrays, maps, and complex records), making it ideal for storing semi-structured data from JSON or Avro sources while maintaining query efficiency. Parquet's internal structure uses techniques like dictionary encoding for low-cardinality columns, bit-packing for small integers, run-length encoding for repeated values, and delta encoding for sorted data, all of which contribute to both storage efficiency and query speed. The format includes column statistics (min/max values, null counts) stored in file metadata that enable predicate pushdown—allowing query engines to skip entire row groups or files that don't contain relevant data based on filter conditions. This combination of columnar organization, advanced encoding schemes, efficient compression, predicate pushdown, and schema evolution support makes Parquet the optimal choice for data warehouse tables, analytical datasets, machine learning feature stores, time-series data, and any scenario where fast analytical queries over large datasets are required, often achieving 10-100x improvements in query performance and storage efficiency compared to row-oriented formats.
