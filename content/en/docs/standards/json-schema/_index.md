JSON Schema is a vocabulary for annotating and validating JSON documents. It defines the structure, content, and constraints of data—often authored in either JSON or YAML—and can be leveraged by documentation generators, validators, and other tooling.

The specification traces back to early proposals by Kris Zyp in 2007 and has evolved through draft-04, draft-06, and draft-07 to the current 2020-12 release.

JSON Schema provides a rich set of keywords—such as title, description, type, properties, required, additionalProperties, minimum, maximum, exclusiveMinimum, exclusiveMaximum, default, enum, pattern, items, allOf, anyOf, oneOf, not, examples, and $ref—to describe and validate data used in business operations.

To get involved with the community, visit the JSON Schema GitHub organization, subscribe to the blog via RSS, join discussions and meetings in the Slack workspace, and follow updates on LinkedIn.

JSON Schema is a foundational standard used by many other specifications, tools, and services. It’s the workhorse for defining and validating the digital data that keeps modern businesses running.
