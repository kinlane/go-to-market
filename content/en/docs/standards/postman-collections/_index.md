A Postman Collection is a portable JSON artifacts that organizes one or more API requests—plus their params, headers, auth, scripts, and examples—so you can run, share, and automate them in the Postman desktop or web client application. Collections can include folders, collection- and environment-level variables, pre-request and test scripts, examples, mock server definitions, and documentation.

Postman Collections started as a simple way to save and share API requests in the early Postman client (2013), then grew into a formal JSON format with the v1 schema published in 2015. The format then stabilized as v2.0.0 and shortly after as v2.1.0 in 2017, which remains the common export/import version today.
