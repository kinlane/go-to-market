JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format that has become the de facto standard for data exchange on the web and between applications. Originally derived from JavaScript object literal syntax, JSON uses a simple, human-readable structure consisting of key-value pairs (objects), ordered lists (arrays), and primitive data types including strings, numbers, booleans, and null. Its straightforward syntax makes it easy for both humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate, which has contributed to its widespread adoption across virtually all programming languages and platforms. JSON's simplicity—using only curly braces for objects, square brackets for arrays, and colons to separate keys from values—makes it accessible to developers while remaining efficient enough for production use in everything from REST APIs to configuration files.

Beyond its use in web APIs and AJAX communications, JSON has become the preferred format for configuration files, data storage in NoSQL databases like MongoDB and CouchDB, and data serialization in modern applications. Unlike XML, JSON has minimal overhead with no opening and closing tags, making payloads smaller and faster to transmit over networks. JSON's language-agnostic nature means that nearly every programming language has robust libraries for parsing and generating JSON, enabling seamless interoperability between systems written in different languages. While JSON lacks some features found in other formats—such as comments (though JSON5 and JSONC variants address this), schema validation (addressed by JSON Schema), and support for binary data (typically handled through Base64 encoding)—its balance of simplicity, readability, and universal support has made it the most popular data interchange format in modern software development, particularly in microservices architectures, cloud services, and mobile applications.
