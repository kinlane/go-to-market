The Arazzo Specification is a community-driven, open standard within the OpenAPI Initiative (a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project). It defines a programming-language-agnostic way to express sequences of calls and the dependencies between them to achieve a specific outcome.

Arazzo emerged from a need identified in the OpenAPI community for orchestration and automation across APIs described with OpenAPI. Version 1 of the specification is available, and work on future iterations is guided by a public roadmap.

With Arazzo, you can define elements such as: Info, Sources, Workflows, Steps, Parameters, Success Actions, Failure Actions, Components, Reusables, Criteria, Request Bodies, and Payload Replacements—providing a consistent approach to delivering a wide range of automation outcomes.

You can engage with the Arazzo community via the GitHub repository for each version and participate in GitHub Discussions to stay current on meetings and interact with the specification’s stewards and the broader community.

Arazzo is the logical layer on top of OpenAPI: it goes beyond documentation, mocking, and SDKs to focus on defining real business workflows that use APIs. Together, Arazzo and OpenAPI help align API operations with the rest of the business.
