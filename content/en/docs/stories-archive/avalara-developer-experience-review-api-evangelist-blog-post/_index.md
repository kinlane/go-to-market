title: Avalara Developer Experience Review
description: >-
  Avalara asked me to take a look at their API portal and provide feedback on their API experience -- which resulted in pretty compelling review and will continue with a deeper dive on their APIs and MCP servers. I will then explore the possibilities for using as part of our AI orchestration use case because this is where they appear to be at in their journey.
