title: We've Been Wrong About API Reuse All Along
description: >-
  Established thinking in large organisations has been to focus API reuse goals and metrics on internal, in-house produced APIs. The logic is straightforward: build once, reuse everywhere, and maximise the return on investment for internally developed services.  However, recent insights suggest we've been looking at API reuse through the wrong lens. The real opportunity—and the real risks—lie not in producer-side reuse, but in how we enable engineers to consume our and third-party APIs efficiently, securely, and with proper governance.
