title: Exploring What Schema Tools Are Available
description: >-
  Do a fresh round-up of the schema tooling available. Specifically for the standards we are supporting, beginning with JSON Schema, but then also focusing on each of the specs and how their schema are managed or not. Round-up tooling, evaluate and apply metadata, and add to tooling section and link to any relevant standards, then publish a story on the subject.
