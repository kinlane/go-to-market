Drowning in distributed system chaos? You're not alone. In this episode, Ken Lane sits down with David Boyne, creator of Event Catalog, to explore how organizations can bring order to the madness of modern architectures. David shares how his open-source tool evolved from a simple event documentation project into a powerful way to map domains, visualize boundaries, and make sense of the services, schemas, and signals flowing through the enterprise. They dig into the synergy between event-driven architecture and domain-driven design, why business context matters as much as technical specs, and how documenting your architecture today could become the foundation for AI and agent-driven automation tomorrow. Whether you're a developer buried in undocumented microservices or a product owner trying to understand what you actually have, this conversation offers a fresh perspective on turning architectural chaos into clarity.
