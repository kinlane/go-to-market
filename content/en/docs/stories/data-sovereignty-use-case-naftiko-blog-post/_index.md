title: Data Sovereignty Use Case - Naftiko Blog
description: >-
  This is blog post on the AI Context use case, focusing on empowering companies to take control of their data that resides across the third-party SaaS solutions they use regularly. The data sovereignty movement is centered on establishing more control over the data generated across the different services you depend on, ensuring data is integrated, migrated, and synced to data and object stores where a company has full control and access.

## Title

- Data Sovereignty

## Tagline

- Govern, encrypt, and audit how data moves through your entire stack.
- APIs, SaaS tools, and AI all touch sensitive data but governance rarely keeps up. Shadow IT, unencrypted transfers, and compliance risk abound.

## Description

This use case focuses on empowering companies to take control of their data that resides across the third-party SaaS solutions they use regularly. The data sovereignty movement is centered on establishing more control over the data generated across the different services you depend on, ensuring data is integrated, migrated, and synced to data and object stores where a company has full control and access.

Data sovereignty enables teams to localize data and train local AI models using the data they produce across third-party platforms. This use case may be aligned with country or regional regulations, or it may simply be part of enterprise compliance programs. Data sovereignty investments have increased as part of the growth of AI integrations and the need for context across third-party systems, as well as the increasing value of data itself.
