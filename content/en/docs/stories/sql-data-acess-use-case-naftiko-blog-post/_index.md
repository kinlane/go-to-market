title: SQL Data Access Use Case - Naftiko Blog
description: >-
  This is blog post on the  SQL Data Access use case, focusing on consistently unlocking the data companies currently depend upon across multiple third-party SaaS providers and a variety of existing database connections via JDBC and ODBC to ensure AI integrations have the data they require. Data today is spread across many internal and external systems, and making it consistently available as part of AI integrations has significantly slowed the delivery of new products and features.

## Title

- SQL Data Access

## Tagline

- Data lives in silos. Teams want insights now but every new API means another custom connector.

## Body

This use case seeks to consistently unlock the data companies currently depend upon across multiple third-party SaaS providers and a variety of existing database connections via JDBC and ODBC to ensure AI integrations have the data they require. Data today is spread across many internal and external systems, and making it consistently available as part of AI integrations has significantly slowed the delivery of new products and features.

Teams benefit from consistent SQL access to data sources via ODBC/JDBC interfaces, and expanding this access to third-party SaaS will help teams provide the context, resources, tooling, and data needed to deliver AI integrations across the enterprise. The capability and resulting engine deployment for this use case provides a unified, consolidated, and simplified approach to providing the data needed to power individual AI integrations within specific business domains.
