The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a standards organization that oversees the global coordination of critical Internet resources to ensure the network functions smoothly and reliably. IANA's primary responsibilities fall into three main categories: managing the DNS root zone (including the delegation of top-level domains like .com, .org, and country code domains), coordinating the global allocation of IP addresses and Autonomous System Numbers to Regional Internet Registries, and maintaining protocol parameter registries that define the unique codes and numbering systems used in Internet protocols published as RFCs (Request for Comments). These registries ensure that protocols have globally unique meanings so that computers and networks around the world can communicate effectively with each other.

While the Internet is renowned for being decentralized without central coordination, IANA provides the necessary technical coordination for key elements that must be globally managed to keep the Internet running. IANA works closely with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to allocate and maintain the unique codes and numbering systems used in technical standards, ensuring that billions of devices can communicate effectively across the Internet. Operating as part of ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) since 1999, IANA's work happens behind the scenes every time someone accesses a website, sends an email, or uses any online service—making it possible for devices worldwide to find each other and exchange information reliably and securely.
