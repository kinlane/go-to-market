IETF is an open international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers who develop and promote voluntary internet standards, particularly the standards that comprise the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP). The IETF is responsible for creating many of the core technical standards that make the internet work, including protocols like HTTP, TLS/SSL, DNS, and many others.

The IETF operates through working groups that focus on specific areas of internet technology, and their standards are published as RFCs (Requests for Comments). It's a volunteer-driven organization with no formal membership requirements - anyone interested in internet standards can participate in their work.
