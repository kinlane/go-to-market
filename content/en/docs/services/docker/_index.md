description: >-
  Docker is a software platform that allows developers to package, distribute,
  and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone,
  and portable environments that contain everything needed to run an
  application, including code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
  Docker provides a way to streamline the development and deployment process by
  isolating applications in containers, making it easier to manage dependencies,
  scale applications, and ensure consistency across different environments.
  Docker simplifies the process of building, deploying, and managing
  applications, ultimately leading to increased efficiency and productivity for
  developers.
