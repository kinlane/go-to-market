Currently there are three main channels in which the Naftiko go-to-market focuses, with other supporting channels supporting along the way, helping keep things focused on a regular drumbeat of activity across these locations.

The Naftiko blog is the primary destination for stories and conversations, providing a regular and consistent cadence when it comes to storytelling across a variety of topics, but centered around capabilities, building traffic over time and using it as a center of other networks.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fab fa-kit fa-api-icon" title="API Evangelist" url="/technology/docs/channels/api-evangelist" %}}
We publish to API Evangelist properties to take advantage of existing SEO and traffic, but also to provide a more opinionated perspective on some topics that we probably wouldn't want to publish to the primary Naftiko blog, keeping the brands separate but working together.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fab fa-kit fa-medium-icon" title="Medium" url="/technology/docs/channels/medium" %}}
We are using Medium as a secondary blog network, while also using it for information gathering as part of market research, but we will increasingly be publishing blog posts there that we first publish to the Naftiko blog, and then syndicate later to Medium for the network effect.

<h1>Social Media</h1>
We are staying focused on two social media channels right now until we get our footing underneath us as part of our go-to-market, syndicating content to both locations, but also leveraging the network effect that exists on these two platforms.
