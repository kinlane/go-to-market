This is the go-to-market documentation site for Naftiko. It contains all of the stories, conversations, and channels we will be publishing to. It provides an ongoing snaprshot of our go-to-market function, providing a blueprint for me to follow when getting the word out about what we are building at Naftiko, and once we have a product to put in the hands of developers, we'll already have this machine broken in.

Like the technology, market research, and revenue sites the goal is to define things early on and publish somewhere we can share with investors, analysts, and team members, as well as eventually the public. It should provide a one-stop for anyone curious about what is happening with the go-to-market motion, as well as all the information you need to get involved and begin contributing stories, participating in conversations, help get others involved, while I use as the daily playbook.
