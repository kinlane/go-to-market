This is the first blog post for the go to market website. Like the market research and revenue sites this documentation site is meant to document the go to market activities as they occur. We started with the calendar for working back from launching in APIDays, but then continue building what we need beyond APIDays. The goal is to provide details about ongoing activities around driving the conversation around AI integration in the ecosystem.

I will be providing regular updates here, then syndicating them to Slack as necessary. The goal of this blog is to keep the team up to date, while providing a place we can document everything happening in real time. Making it easy to share information, media, and other inportant details needed to get the word out about what we are doing. This website should link to everything we are using to plan go to market, and eventually become something we are sharing and using to drive discussion in the ecosystem.
