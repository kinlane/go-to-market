  This is the coming out to the community update for the go-to-market documentation site.

This is the go-to-market site for Naftiko. It provides the entire blueprint for how Naftiko conducts marketing and evangelism. Like our market research, technology, and revenue site we don't see any reason why we shouldn't be doing all this work out in the open and sharing with the community as we progress--allowing others to learn from, join in, making the go-to-market motion a community thing.

I use the YAML for capabilities, channels, events, glossary, organizations, services, standards, stories, and use cases in this Docsy site hosted on GitHub to manage all the ideas and activities I am setting in motion on any given day. I use the issues for the repo as an inbox, submitting ideas as I move fast through a variety of conversations and content work. Feel free to jump and use anything here, as I continue to execute our GTM motion, automate a lot of what I do, and work to amplify Naftiko, but also the open-source stanards and tooling we are building on.
