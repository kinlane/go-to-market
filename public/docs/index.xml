      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we work to define our go-to-market motion at Naftiko we felt there was no reason to keep the process behind a secret. We have an initial plan in place, but our go-to-market is someething that will continue to evolve and change over time based upon the stories we tell and the conversations we have, so we thought it would help increase the velocity of our go-to-market flywheel if we just did it all out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
